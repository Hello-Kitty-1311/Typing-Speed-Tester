# Typing Speed Tester
a website i made to see how fast i can type. it gives you a random piece of text and you just type it out in the box below.it has some cool features. you can pick different difficulty levels from easy sentences to really hard ones with big words. you can also choose how long you want the test to be from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. while you type it shows you you're wpm (words per minute) your accuracy and other stats like your longest correct typing streak. it even saves you're personal best scores and a history of your last few tests so you can see if you're getting better. and of course it has a dark mode.

## Why i made this webpage

* i was using other typing websites but they were all full of ads and felt old
* i wanted to practice with harder text with more technical words
* i wanted to track my progress over time without having to make an account
* so i just decided to make my own it was a good way to practice my javascript skills

## How i made it

* i made this webpage using html css and javascript so it does not depend on any dependency easy to plug and play

## struggles and what i have learned

*   omg the timer was so annoying at first the pause button was completely broken
*   when i clicked resume it would start a *new* timer on top of the old one so the time would count down twice as fast
*   i learned you have to be really careful to clear the old timer before starting a new one
*   i also struggled with `localStorage` i tried to save my score object directly and it didnt work
*   i learned you have to convert your objects into a text format called json first before you can save it
*   also just handling all the little details like what happens when you press backspace was a lot of work
*   i learned that even a "simple" app has a ton of little edge cases you have to think about
